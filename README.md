# Personal website

This is the repository for my personal website, [hi.markus.im](https://hi.markus.im). This is not
finished but I'll keep on working on this from time to time when I have time. Below is a list of the
most important things that haven't been done yet but need to be done.

- Improve the accessibility
- Add proper [meta tags](https://devhints.io/html-meta) for sharing
- Improve the responsiveness handling to be more consistent
- Move these to issues!
- Add ESLint
- Add CI for linting (both ESLint and Prettier)
- Improve the design. Someone with better design skills?
- Set up email for hi@markus.im and add contact information
